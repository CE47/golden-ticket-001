rem  ESBOOT is only used once, to create the account Kibana runs as. Kibana

rem  cannot create the .kibana* saved-object indices, so the account also

rem ------------------------------------------ install the detection rule
rem  This is the whole point of the rule: without a fired rule the Alerts page
rem  renders nothing at all, so a walkthrough that opens Alerts would be a dead
rem  end. The rule is installed through Kibana rather than through
rem  Elasticsearch's own rule API, because Kibana is what actually runs the
rem  alerting engine and what writes the alerts the page reads.
rem
rem  It is deliberately idempotent by name. The create route always mints a new
rem  rule id and there is no update-by-id route, so a second run would install a
rem  second copy and every alert would be counted twice. Counting first is
rem  cheap and needs only a single number back, which is the one thing a batch
rem  file can parse without ceremony.

)
rem  A match_phrase on the rule's name is used rather than a term on its
rem  keyword subfield.  The keyword subfield is normalised to lower case, and
rem  cmd.exe has no way to lower-case a string without a loop that is easy to
rem  get wrong; an analysed text match is already case-insensitive, so the
rem  name can be written here exactly as it is written in rule.json.
