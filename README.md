# CTIA Scenario Lab — golden-ticket-001

A self-contained SOC analyst training scenario. Investigate it in Kibana using the
step-by-step guide, then write up and submit your findings.

## The scenario

On the evening of **22 September 2026** a detection rule fires on one workstation. One
host asked for Kerberos service tickets across a wide sweep of different service
principal names, all drawn for the domain administrator identity, seconds apart and well
inside a single minute — then opened administrative network sessions on servers it had
never touched before, and read an internal file server. That is the signature of
**golden-ticket forgery**: tickets minted with the domain's own `krbtgt` signing key, so
no password is ever checked and nothing ever fails.

The analyst has to confirm it, quantify it, find out who was on the machine, and write a
report that says what the data cannot prove as well as what it can. The event code alone
will not get them there — the day is full of ordinary Kerberos traffic — so it is the
source address that separates the attack from the noise.

Two synthetic, deterministic log sources are loaded into Elasticsearch:

| Data view | What it covers |
|---|---|
| `auth-*` | Windows security-style authentication events: logons, logoffs, failures, lockouts, privilege assignment, Kerberos pre-auth failures, Kerberos service-ticket requests, process starts |
| `network-*` | Connection events between hosts and toward external peers: SMB, RPC, DNS queries and their answers, LDAP, HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, ICMP |

Timestamps are stored in UTC. Kibana displays them in your own timezone — read the
clock times off your own screen and judge the gaps between events, not the absolute
numbers.

## How to run the lab

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CE47/golden-ticket-001.git
cd golden-ticket-001
```

### 2a. Windows — set up Docker Desktop

1. Install **WSL** (Windows Subsystem for Linux). In an elevated PowerShell window:

   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```

   Restart Windows when it asks, then run `wsl --install --no-distribution` again if
   needed. Verify with `wsl --status`.

2. Install **Docker Desktop for Windows** from <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/>.
   Let it finish installing WSL 2 backend updates, then launch Docker Desktop and
   wait until the whale icon reports **Engine running**.

### 2b. Linux / macOS — set up Docker

Install **Docker Desktop** (<https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/>) or
Docker Engine with the Compose plugin, make sure it is running, and skip to step 3.

### 3. Build the lab

Double-click **`setup-lab.cmd`** (Windows), or run `./setup-lab.sh` in a terminal
(Linux / macOS).

The script builds and verifies everything in ten stages: it starts Elasticsearch and
Kibana in Docker, installs the index templates, imports the datasets, creates the
`auth` and `network` data views, and installs the detection rule that populates the
Alerts page. First run downloads over a gigabyte of images, so be patient. When it
finishes it prints:

```
The lab is ready.
Kibana        : http://localhost:5601
Kibana login  lab_kibana / LabKibana001
```

and it opens Kibana in your browser. Sign in with the lab credentials if prompted.
They are throwaway credentials and protect nothing.

### 4. Perform the investigation

Work in Kibana with the guide open beside you:

- **`guided-walkthrough.html`** — open it in any browser (no server, no internet
  needed). It is a card deck that walks you from an empty screen to a signed-off
  verdict, with screenshots taken from this exact lab, the investigation queries to
  run, and where to find each answer.
- The setup script also prints the investigation queries and the number of results
  each one must return — that is your reference sheet.

Useful starting points in Kibana: `Security → Alerts` (alerts fired, severity
**Critical**) and the `auth` / `network` data views under **Discover**.

### 5. Write it up and submit

The **`Write it up`** card in `guided-walkthrough.html` is your deliverable. It has
input boxes that start empty on purpose: fill in the report sections, check off the
figures you found against your own screen, enter your name and batch number, then
press **`EXPORT MY SUBMISSION`**.

A PDF of your typed report is built in your browser and saved to your **Downloads**
folder — nothing is uploaded. That PDF is your submission for this activity.

### 6. Clean up

When you have exported and submitted your report:

- **Windows:** double-click `teardown.cmd`
- **Linux / macOS:** run `./teardown.sh`

Both remove exactly what the setup created, named after this folder, and never touch
other Docker resources or other labs.

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | this file |
| `guided-walkthrough.html` | **the investigation guide and the write-up / submission form — open this in a browser** |
| `auth.ndjson` / `auth.json` | auth events (284 docs) and the `auth-*` index template |
| `network.ndjson` / `network.json` | network events (136 docs) and the `network-*` index template |
| `rule.json` | the detection rule the lab installs, so the Alerts page is not empty |
| `setup-lab.cmd` / `setup-lab.sh` | **Windows / Linux-macOS.** One-click lab build, fully verified |
| `teardown.cmd` / `teardown.sh` | **Windows / Linux-macOS.** Safe, scenario-scoped, idempotent removal |

`docker-compose.yml` is generated by the setup script; delete it and re-run setup to
rebuild it.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `docker` is not recognized | Install and start Docker Desktop, then reopen the terminal |
| Setup fails at the Docker check | Docker is not running — launch Docker Desktop and wait for **Engine running** |
| Setup fails later with a container error | `docker logs golden-ticket-001-elasticsearch` |
| Kibana shows no data | Check the time range picker covers `2026-09-22 00:00` → `2026-09-22 23:59` (UTC) |
| Want a clean slate | Run `teardown.cmd` / `./teardown.sh`, then setup again |
